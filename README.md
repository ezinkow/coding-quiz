## About This Project:

This was a homework assignment as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. We were tasked with building a coding quiz with certain rules. The questions appear one at a time, there is a timer that decreases with every incorrect answer, and the user is able to save their score when finished.

This website was built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Summary of Project:

The website is a coding quiz consisting of ten questions about JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The questions appear one at a time, advancing when the user answers each question. Every correct answer gives the user 1 point, and every incorrect answer decreases the timer by 10 seconds. When finished, or when the time runs out, the user is prompted to enter their initials and save their score.
